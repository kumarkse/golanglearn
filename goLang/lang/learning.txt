go mod init _name_

methods from packages are capitalized

you can just write the code , go automatically imports and remove packages that is in need

go run file.go 
go build file.go

Go is a tool for managing Go source code.

Usage:

        go <command> [arguments]  for documentation

case sensitive

var varname type = _ _
varname := _ _  (this declaration not aloowed when declaring outside a function)

var smallval uint8 -> 0 to 255 only allowed

uint8: 8-bit unsigned integers (0 to 255)
uint16: 16-bit unsigned integers (0 to 65535)
uint32: 32-bit unsigned integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64: 64-bit unsigned integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)
int8: 8-bit signed integers (−128 to 127)
int16: 16-bit signed integers (−32768 to 32767)
int32: 32-bit signed integers (−2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64: 64-bit signed integers (−9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32: IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers  i.e 6 decimal points
float64: IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers  i.e 14 points

complex64: Complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128: Complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte: Alias for uint8
rune: Alias for int32

default value is zero 0

 ---------- variable name with initial capital is public by nature

while taking input we have:
varname , _  := reader.Read(type).......
here  , _ is the err 


you need to trim space before converting the inputted value so as to remove the \n present in end

GOOS="windows" go build   ->  build exe file for windows

garbage collection in runtime package in doc

NO classes so no inheritence,super,parent,child...
so we have struct

NO ++i

NO while loop , substituted the keyword while by for , ! thats int16

No nested function ,  but ananymous func allowed

defer keyword what it does is that it instaed of line by line by line execution , the line which has defered keyword mentioned is executed at the last
and in opposite order

panic(err) shuts down the prgram executio and shows the error in terminal

HTTP package for web help

readResponse and respomseWritw does not close the connection

type Response struct {
StatusCode
ProtoMajor
ProtoMinor
Request.Method
TransferEncoding
Trailer
Body
ContentLength
Header, values for non-canonical keys will have unpredictable behavior
}


in Go , files in same directory should have same package name and for a file havinga mmain function , it must have a package main

for printf:
        %d integer ,  %f float , %T for type printing , %s for string

to read single non spaced values , use scanf
else use bufio

In Switch case , case can contain multiple comma seperated values

in Map , when accesing a key vaue , 2 things are returned : value for the key and its existence

Strings is the library for the string ds

For date and time , 
        date -> 02
        month-> 01
        year -> 2006
        day  -> Monday
        hrs  -> 15
        min  -> 04
        sec  -> 05
